This version of EasyTag is maintained in a git repository on github as
the project never had a publicly accessible version control
repository. The initial repository was created from a number of
publicly available tarballs. You can find the current state of the
repository at:

    https://github.com/stsquad/easytag

It is intended as a place where patches and pull requests can be
processed until Jérôme starts making releases again (hopefully with a
public repo). In the meantime patches that look sane and don't crash
EasyTag it will be accepted by myself.

Contributing
============

My preferences for contributions are as follows:

1. Pull request on github
2. Pull request from another git repository
3. Patches

Patches are fine but GIT pull requests make it a lot easier to keep
attribution correct and it makes my life easier ;-)

Coding Style
============

I couldn't find any reference to the style to follow but running
indent_finder.py suggests the code is currently:

    No Tabs, Indent Level of 4 characters

In Emacs the style can be set by the following:

   (defconst easytag-c-style
    '(
       (indent-tabs-mode . nil)
       (c-basic-offset . 4)
       (c-comment-only-line-offset . 0))
       "EasyTag Programming Style")
