Patches are best filed on Bugzilla, but a pull request is also fine.

Coding Style
------------

The original EasyTAG coding style was close to K&R style, with four-space
indents. This has been changed slightly to the following guidelines:

* BSD/Allman brace style
* One space before opening bracket, none after opening or closing
* Four space indent
* Try to keep to 80 character lines
* Space after ',', spaces around logical operators
* Function return values on a line separate from the function name

New code should follow this style.
