DESCRIPTION:
============
EasyTAG is an utility for viewing and editing tags for MP3, MP2, FLAC, Ogg 
Vorbis, Speex, MP4/AAC, MusePack, Monkey's Audio and WavPack files. Its simple 
and nice GTK2 interface makes tagging easier under GNU/Linux or Windows.


FEATURES:
=========
Currently EasyTAG supports the following:


  o View, edit, write tags of MP3, MP2 files (ID3 tag with pictures), FLAC files
    (FLAC Vorbis tag), Ogg Vorbis and Speex files (Ogg Vorbis tag), MP4/AAC 
    (MP4/AAC tag), MusePack, Monkey's Audio and WavPack files (APE tag),
  o Can edit more tag fields : Title, Artist, Album, Disc Album, Year, Track
    Number, Genre, Comment, Composer, Original Artist/Performer, Copyright, URL
    and Encoder name,
  o Auto tagging: parse filename and directory to complete automatically the
    fields (using masks),
  o Ability to rename files and directories from the tag (using masks) or by
    loading a text file,
  o Process selected files of the selected directory,
  o Ability to browse subdirectories,
  o Recursion for tagging, removing, renaming, saving...,
  o Can set a field (artist, title,...) to all other selected files,
  o Read file header informations (bitrate, time, ...) and display them,
  o Auto completion of the date if a partial is entered,
  o Undo and redo last changes,
  o Ability to process fields of tag and file name (convert letters into
    uppercase, downcase, ...),
  o Ability to open a directory or a file with an external program,
  o Remote and local CDDB support for manual or automatic search,
  o A tree based browser or a view by Artist & Album,
  o A list to select files,
  o A playlist generator window,
  o A file searching window,
  o Simple and explicit interface!,
  o Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, 
    German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Romanian, Russian, 
    Spanish, Swedish and Ukrainian translation languages,
  o Written in C and uses GTK+ 2 for the GUI.


INSTALLATION:
=============

1. Requirements :
=================

 - glib version highter than 2.8.0 (http://www.gtk.org) (Recommended: gtk+-2.8.4)
 - GTK version highter than 2.4.1 (http://www.gtk.org) (Recommended: gtk+-2.4.14)
 - id3lib version highter than 3.7.12 (http://id3lib.sourceforge.net) (Recommended: id3lib-3.8.3)
 - libogg and libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com) (if not deactivated by './configure --disable-ogg')
 - flac (http://flac.sourceforge.net) (if not deactivated by './configure --disable-flac')
 - libmp4v2 (http://mp4v2.googlecode.com/) (if not deactivated by './configure --disable-mp4') (Recommended: libmp4v2-1.9.0)
 - wavpack (http://www.wavpack.com/) (if not deactivated by './configure --disable-wavpack')
 - libc 6 (glibc 2.1) or better
 - intltool (if not deactivated by './configure --disable-nls')


2. Compilation Instructions :
=============================

 2.1. Before to compile EasyTAG you need to install some libraries.

  2.1.1. To install id3lib :
 - recompile sources of id3lib (id3lib-3.x.x.tar.gz) (Recommended),
 - or install id3lib-3.x.x.i386.rpm and id3lib-devel-3.x.x.i386.rpm
   then run the command 'ldconfig' to update shared library symlinks.
   
   (Nota: to see if links have been updated, run the command 'ldconfig -p|grep libid3'
          if all is ok, it'll return lines like this :
             libid3.so (libc6) => /usr/lib/libid3.so
             libid3-3.8.so.2 (libc6) => /usr/lib/libid3-3.8.so.2 )

  2.1.2. To install libogg and libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com) :

    Follow the same procedure as id3lib with the following packages :
        - http://fatpipe.vorbis.com/files/1.0/unix/libogg-1.0.tar.gz
        - http://fatpipe.vorbis.com/files/1.0/unix/libogg-1.0-1.i386.rpm
        - http://fatpipe.vorbis.com/files/1.0/unix/libogg-devel-1.0-1.i386.rpm
        
        - http://fatpipe.vorbis.com/files/1.0/unix/libvorbis-1.0.tar.gz
        - http://fatpipe.vorbis.com/files/1.0/unix/libvorbis-1.0-1.i386.rpm
        - http://fatpipe.vorbis.com/files/1.0/unix/libvorbis-devel-1.0-1.i386.rpm

  2.1.3. To install flac (http://flac.sourceforge.net) :

  2.1.4. To install faad2 (http://www.audiocoding.com/) :
        Else, you can install MPEG4IP (http://mpeg4ip.net/)

 2.2. Unpack the sources of EasyTAG with

    > tar xfvz easytag-x.y.z.tar.gz
(x.y.z represents the version of package, for example : 0.27.1) 

 2.3. Change into the new directory

    > cd easytag-x.y.z/

 2.4. Compile and install the program

    > ./configure
    > make
    # make install (You need root privileges)

Notes : 
 - If you want to compile EasyTAG with gcc3.x, you MUST install a version of id3lib compiled
with the same version of the compiler.
 - If you have the both versions of gcc installed (2.9x and 3.x), use the command './configure CC=gcc3'
for compiling with gcc3.

You may now run the program by simply typing "easytag".
(Of course the directory in which you installed it (usually /usr/local/bin) has to 
be in your PATH)



3. RPM Building Instructions (RedHat 6.x 7.x) :
===============================================

If you prefer manipulate a RPM, you can build it with the following commands:

 3.1. Build the RPM

    # rpm -tb easytag-x.y.z.tar.gz
   or
    # rpm --rebuild easytag-x.y.z.src.rpm
   or
    copy easytag-x.y.z.tar.gz into directory /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, get easytag.spec
    into tarball, and run :
        # rpm -bb easytag.spec

 3.2. If succeed, you will found the rpm in /usr/src/redhat/RPM/i386/



4. RPM Building Instructions (RedHat 8.x 9) :
=============================================

If you prefer manipulate a RPM, you can build it with the following commands:

 4.1. Build the RPM

    # rpmbuild -tb easytag-x.y.z.tar.gz
   or
    # rpmbuild --rebuild easytag-x.y.z.src.rpm
   or
    copy easytag-x.y.z.tar.gz into directory /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, get easytag.spec
    into tarball, and run:
        # rpmbuild -bb easytag.spec

 4.2. If succeed, you will found the rpm in /usr/src/redhat/RPM/i386/



5. Adding a new translation file to EasyTAG :
=============================================
All catalogs are placed into po/ directory and are named as the following: fr.po for 
France, de.po for Germany, and so on.

The catalogs which will be compiled with EasyTAG are set into configure.in file, into
field ALL_LINGUAS. If you have created a new translation file for your location, and 
want to test it, add the corresponding code (xx for file xx.po) to this field.

Then run the script: ./autogen.sh before to recompile program (see instructions of 
paragraph 2).


6. Applying a patch :
=====================

 6.1. Unpack the sources (see 2.2),
 6.2. Go into the directory where you unpack sources (the parent directory of easytag-x.y.z directory)
 6.3. Put the patch file in this directory
 6.4. Apply the patch:
   for example:

    > cat patch_easytag_027_027a.diff | patch -p0   (if patch file was named : patch_easytag_027_027a.diff)

(Note: the pacth file (of above example) is a diff file made with command:
       diff -ruN easytag-0.27/ easytag-0.27a/ > patch_easytag_027_027a.diff
       in the directory where are locate easytag-0.4 and easytag-0.4a directories)
 6.5. Recompile program (see 2.3 + 2.4).


7. Segfault occurs when running EasyTAG? :
==========================================
 The best way to allow us to fix the problem, is to send back a backtrace :
 
 7.1. Be sure that core files are availables
    If 'ulimit -c' returns 0, then run the command 'ulimit -c unlimited'
 7.2. Get the backtrace with 'gdb easytag core' (note that on some systems, the
    core file is suffixed by the pid. So use 'core._pid_number_' instead of only
    'core').
    
    > gdb easytag core._pid_number_
    gdb> bt
    gdb> ...
    gdb> l
    gdb> ...
